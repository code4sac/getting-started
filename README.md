# Getting Started
This repo for getting started contributing to Code for Sacramento


## Local Development
A lot of our repositories use Docker for local development.  Docker is a piece of software that allows us to package a lot of dependencies from the operating system level up into each project.  This means that you do not need to install many dependencies on your host system in order to run the majority of our active projects.

If you do not have docker installed, please do the following depending on your type of system:

- [Docker Windows](docker-windows.md)
- [Docker MacOS](docker-macos.md)


## Git
We use git for all of our projects, and it is necessary in order to contribute to our project code.  Below are some resources to get started with git.

- [Install Git Windows](git-windows.md)
- [Install Git MacOS](git-macos.md)
